Just_We's short notes about what we have found in the Node.js.

Installing
----------

[Node.js official] you can install official node.js.
Use LATEST version if you are feeling that are going to learn about it as max, as you can, or if your course is so new, that it will use the newest features.
Use LTS version if you want to make some great working project.

Also you need NPM. It should be included in Node.js installation.

To check that you currently have them in terminal or cmd:
```bash
	node -v
	npm -v
```

If you have some started files. Use npm to install all listed packadges that needed for project functionality.
For this:
in terminal go to the project dir and type:
```bash
	npm install
```

Npm install is looking for the file package.json and install all listed there dependencies.

While you are using some text editor you should be able to link the other files in your html for better work flow.
For this use [Pug].
It's also available in mostly all modern text editors as plugin. So, make sure that you are using it.

If you care about what texteditor to use(and othre soft) we are recommending to visit this such a great man's page http://wesbos.com/uses
